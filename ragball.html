    <h1>Ragball</h1>
    <p>
        Ragball is exactly what you think it is. It is a soccer game where every single aspect of player movement
        is controlled with in-game physics. By blending the complete 'jankyness' of physics based controllers with
        a bit of invisible aimbot, this turned out to be my game which received the most positive feedback, despite
        the core of it being coded in the span of less than a week. Ragdolls are awesome.

        This video was shared previous to a play-testing session at Wonderville NYC. The meta has since developed, but
        this still stands as solid gameplay and decent demonstration of skill from my part ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

        Here we see the shortest snippet of the final game of a best-of-3 set between four play-testers. I was incredibly
        invested, so this was truly all I managed to capture. It is impossible to decipher from the GIF above, but there
        were two goals in the final 10 seconds, tying the game and sending our players into overtime! Never had a project
        of mine provoked so many bursts of emotion. I only wish I had captured more of it!

    <p>NOTE</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, I am traveling and away from my setup at the moment. As soon as I return, I will upload a
    playable version to itch.io and link it here!</p>
