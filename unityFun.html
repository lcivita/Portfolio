    <h1>Breaking Unity</h1>
    
    <p>
        What I most love about learning graphics programming is that elements of game development that seem entirely
        extraterrestrial slowly start becoming accessible and manipulatable. I've started a new practice where I try
        to customize and break tools given to me by game engines. This can result in one of two outcomes: I either create
        something incredibly useful, or a heaping pile of garbage (which I might love even more!)
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Since this is a page where I am supposed to demonstrate my utility, I will focus on a recent project of mine.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The Unity terrain editor is, for lack of a kinder word, lackluster.
        In working with it, I found myself wishing I had access to so many features that seemed impossible
        to reach!
        So... I made them! Well, some of them.
        I combined my knowledge of the engine and shader programming
        to add a few much-needed features. Below I list these additions!
    </p>

    <br>
    <h3>
        Custom lighting
    </h3>
    <p>
        The terrain material that is used by default in unity does not allow for any shader programming.
        The first step I took was adding custom lighting functionality to it. Below is what happened.
        It might look like a mess, but I can assure you, it was a wonderful sight to behold since it
        meant I had successfully implemented the custom lighting/shading model! What is seen is the surface's
        albedo being altered based on a hash function that processes the terrain's normal.

    <h3>
        Splat map accessibility
    </h3>
    <p>
        I noticed however, that with the new shading model, I had lost complete access to the terrain
        painting features typically available in the Unity terrain editor. I knew however, that the splat
        maps still existed within the terrain data. Upon research and some shadergraph programming, I found
        that I could pass in the splat map as a texture to my shader and process it manually. Below are the
        first modifications I made in order to visualize all channels of said splat map.
    </p>

    <br><br>
    
    <h3>
        Multiple materials per terrain
    </h3>
    <p>
        It was a matter of processing the above mentioned texture in order to allow for multiple materials
        to exist within the same terrain. Well, not quite that, but by programming stepped shaders for each
        channel of the splat map, it was essentially that. Here we see the manipulatable terrain in action,
        albeit most definitely not the most polished of examples. The functionality remains!

    <h3>
        FUTURE PLANS
    </h3>
    <p>
        One feature I have not gotten around to customizing is the sculpting of the terrain itself. Currently,
        the only alternatives are to either use the in-Unity editor, or to edit the RAW file of the height map itself.
        Neither of these seem too appetizing to me, so I intend on working on an alternative solution in the
        near future.
