    <h1>Breaking Unity</h1>

    <br>
    <p>
        What I most love about learning graphics programming is that elements of game development that seem entirely
        extraterrestrial slowly start becoming accessible and manipulatable. I've started a new practice where I try
        to customize and break tools given to me by game engines. This can result in one of two outcomes: I either create
        something incredibly useful, or a heaping pile of garbage (which I might love even more!)
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Since this is a page where I am supposed to demonstrate my utility, I will focus on a recent project of mine.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        I cannot stand the Unity terrain editor. There are so many issues with it, and I found myself wanting certain
        features that I could not find online. So I made them! I combined my knowledge of the engine and shader programming
        to add a few much-needed features to it. Below I list these additions!
    </p>

    <br>
    <p>
        Custom lighting
    </p>
    <p>
        blah blah
    </p>
    <br>
    
    <p>
        Multiple materials per terrain
    </p>
    <p>
        blah blah
    </p>
    <br>

    <p>
        Splat map accessibility
    </p>
    <p>
        blah blah
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        FUTURE PLANS
