        Wiggy Wiggy was a game made for an controller class. our group of three worked on a hairdressing rhythm game
        that put the player in the shoes of a hairdresser in a chaotic wig factory where wigs must be cut and dyed in
        rhythm to music!

        This project was an incredible exercise in physical computing and C# / Unity programming. I was particularly
        put in charge of the Unity development of the project, where I created a set of custom unity editor tools to
        facilitate our processes. It was quite interesting to create a custom input window to scriptable object pipeline
        that allowed us to edit songs and keep them in rhythm easily. Below is a screenshot of the tool I created for
        us to use:

        Wiggy Wiggy has unfortunately not yet gotten past its initial prototyping phase. It was playable, and the few
        people who did play it claimed to have a tremendous amount of fun; however, our child will have to be placed
        on pause for the moment!
